## Note to translators: The User Interface renders Filters 1, 2, 3 next to each other. The English translation gives these the appearance of a sentence, for example: "Top 5, most active people, in the last 14 days".
## This is entirely optional. If the language doesn't allow for this structure, please capitalise the messages in Filter 2+3 so they appear disconnected.

# Filter 1
filter.top5=Top 5
filter.top10=Top 10
