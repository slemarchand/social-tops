You will need to set the tomcat.home\r\nproperty in Ant.\r\n\r\n    ant -Dtomcat.home=C:\\alfresco-community-4.0.e\\tomcat clean hotcopy-tomcat-jar\r\n    \r\nOnce you have run this you will need to restart Tomcat so that the classpath \r\nresources in the JAR file are picked up.","name":"Social-tops"}
